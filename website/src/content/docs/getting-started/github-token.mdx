# GitHub Token Setup

GitDesk uses a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to access your pull request data.

<Aside type="caution">
  Keep your token secure! Never share it or commit it to version control.
</Aside>

## Creating a Personal Access Token

<Steps>
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**

3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "GitDesk Desktop")

4. Select the required scopes:
   - `repo` - Full control of private repositories (required for PR access)
   - `read:user` - Read your profile information

5. Click **"Generate token"**

6. **Copy the token immediately** - you won't be able to see it again!
</Steps>

## Adding the Token to GitDesk

<Steps>
1. Launch GitDesk

2. Paste your token in the authentication screen

3. Click **"Connect"**

4. Your PRs will start loading
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Your token is stored securely using your system's secret storage (GNOME Keyring, KWallet, etc.).
</Aside>

## Token Permissions Explained

| Scope | Why It's Needed |
|-------|----------------|
| `repo` | Access to view PRs in private and public repositories |
| `read:user` | Display your username and avatar |

## Troubleshooting

### "Bad Credentials" Error

- Ensure you copied the entire token
- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Verify the token has the required scopes

### Token Not Saving

- Ensure your system's secret storage service is running
- On GNOME, check that `gnome-keyring` is installed
- On KDE, check that `kwallet` is running
