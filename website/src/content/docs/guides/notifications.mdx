# Desktop Notifications

GitDesk can send desktop notifications to keep you updated on PR activity.

## Notification Types

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Review Requested** | You've been added as a reviewer |
| **PR Updated** | A PR you're reviewing has new commits |
| **Review Received** | Your PR received a review |
| **PR Merged** | A PR you're involved with was merged |

## Enabling Notifications

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to **Notifications**
3. Toggle on the notification types you want

<Aside type="note">
  GitDesk uses your system's native notification system (libnotify on Linux).
</Aside>

## Notification Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Notifications** | Master toggle for all notifications |
| **Sound** | Play a sound with notifications |
| **Review Requests** | Notify when added as reviewer |
| **PR Updates** | Notify on PR activity |

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Showing

1. Check that system notifications are enabled
2. Verify GitDesk has notification permissions
3. Check "Do Not Disturb" mode is off

### On Flatpak

Flatpak apps need notification portal access:

```bash
flatpak permission-show com.openza.gitdesk
```

Ensure `notifications` is listed as `yes`.
