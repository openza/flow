# Desktop Notifications

Openza Flow sends desktop notifications to alert you when new pull requests need your review.

## How It Works

When Openza Flow detects new PR review requests during a refresh, it will send a desktop notification:

- **Single PR**: Shows the PR title and repository name
- **Multiple PRs**: Shows the count of new PRs awaiting your review

<Aside type="note">
  Openza Flow uses your system's native notification system (Windows notifications on Windows, libnotify on Linux).
</Aside>

## Notification Behavior

- Notifications are sent automatically when new review requests are detected
- The first load after launching the app does not trigger notifications
- Subsequent refreshes (auto or manual) will notify you of new PRs

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Showing

1. Check that system notifications are enabled in your desktop environment
2. Verify Openza Flow has notification permissions
3. Check that "Do Not Disturb" mode is off

### On Flatpak

Flatpak apps need notification portal access:

```bash
flatpak permission-show com.openza.flow
```

Ensure `notifications` is listed as `yes`.
